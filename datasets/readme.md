- db_ACSEmployement: This dataset is generated from the Folktables Python package (https://github.com/zykls/folktables) that provides access to datasets derived from the US Census. We have selected the ``Montana'' state only, which results in n=10,336samples with d=18 discrete attributes (target included) and domain size **k**=[92, 25, 5, 2, 2, 9, 4, 5, 5, 4, 2, 18, 2, 2, 3, 9, 3, 6].
- db_Adult: This is a classical dataset from the UCI ML repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult) with n=45,222 samples after cleaning. We selected d=10 attributes ("age",	"workclass", "education",	"marital-status", "occupation", "relationship", "race", "sex", "native-country" and "salary") with domain size **k**=[74, 7, 16, 7, 14, 6, 5, 2, 41, 2], respectively.
