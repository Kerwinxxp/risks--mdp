Re-identification and attribute inference risks of the RS+FD solution.

- The [1_RID_Attack_FK_RS+FD_Adults](https://github.com/hharcolezi/risks-ldp/blob/main/attack_RSpFD/1_RID_Attack_FK_RS%2BFD_Adults.ipynb) Jupyter notebook has the experiments on re-identification attack (full knowledge + uniform Ïµ among users) to the RS+FD solution with the Adult dataset. This means chained attribute inference attack (No Knowledge Model - NK) to profile each user.
- The [2_NK_AIF_Attack_RS+FD_Adult.ipynb](https://github.com/hharcolezi/risks-ldp/blob/main/attack_RSpFD/2_NK_AIF_Attack_RS%2BFD_Adult.ipynb) Jupyter notebook has the experiments on attribute inference attack (No Knowledge Model - NK) to the RS+FD solution with the Adult dataset.
- The [2_PK_AIF_Attack_RS+FD_Adult.ipynb](https://github.com/hharcolezi/risks-ldp/blob/main/attack_RSpFD/2_PK_AIF_Attack_RS%2BFD_Adult.ipynb) Jupyter notebook has the experiments on attribute inference attack (Partial Knowledge Model - PK) to the RS+FD solution with the Adult dataset.
- The [2_HM_AIF_Attack_RS+FD_Adult.ipynb](https://github.com/hharcolezi/risks-ldp/blob/main/attack_RSpFD/2_HM_AIF_Attack_RS%2BFD_Adult.ipynb) Jupyter notebook has the experiments on attribute inference attack (Hybrid Model - HM) to the RS+FD solution with the Adult dataset.
